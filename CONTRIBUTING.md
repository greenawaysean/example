# How to Contribute
Any contribution is welcome and we are grateful for any work that you wish to commit.

## Working on Branches
* Please do not make any changes to the master branch directly - work on a separate branch and submit a merge request instead.
* Be respectful of other users' contributions, keeping in mind they may have different levels of experience to you

## Standardisation of Code
The main language for this project will be Python - when contributing to Python files:
* Please ensure your code conforms to [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) standard.
* Make sure all classes and functions have a descriptive docstring.
* Ensure all variables have informative names, with comments only used when the intended behaviour of the code is not self-evident.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
